### Netflix Episodes Page

#### I designed Netflix home page and category page before. Today, I designed the episodes page with using Html, Scss and Javascript.

### Available Features

#### If you hover the bell, profile and people icon in the navbar, popup window will appear. If you click on the My List button, It will show a check mark and if you press it again, it will go back to the way it was.

#### With the Watch Trailer feature, you can watch the trailer in a pop-up window.

#### When you click the season buttons, it scrolls the current season screen up and shows the season you clicked. I only added 2 seasons button,but more can be added.

#### You can also see how many family members or friends watched and who watched it under each episode. I added a share button but I didn't write a function for that.
